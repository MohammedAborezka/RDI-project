## Introduction
    Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in a text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and others. We used hugging face transformer: CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-mix-ner as our base model, and we fine-tuned it with ANERcorp - CAMeL Lab Dataset. The Final model accuracy is 0.97 on the test dataset.

### Steps of the project:
    1. Explore the ANERCorp Dataset from CamelLabs
    2. Find and add more datasets
    3. Train one or more models
    4. Compare different models using F1 Score

### Current progress:
    - [x] 1. Explore the ANERCorp Dataset from CamelLabs [ANERCorp.ipynb].
    - [x] 2. Train on  [ANERCorp.ipynb].
    - [x] 3. Train one or more models.
    - [ ] 4. Compare different models using F1 Score. (On progress)
    - [ ] 5- Add more Datasets


## Environment
The code is compatible with `Python 3.10.12` and `torch 2.0.1` and `transformers 4.30.2`
